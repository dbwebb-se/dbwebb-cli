Welcome to dbwebb-cli's documentation!
===================================

**dbw** (/debewe/) is a Bash script for working with "course repos".
A course repo is a git repo with a pre-defined structure of course material that the tool dbw knows of.

A course repo is used to gather all material needed for a student to work with a (university) course, usually with programming focus. A course repo contains files for the student, the teacher, documentation, exercises and task, all material included in one git course repo. The dbw utility helps the teacher and the student to work with the course repo.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
